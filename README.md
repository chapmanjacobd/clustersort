TODO:

- try n_gram_range (1,2)
- calculate 'sums' by dot product of X_tfidf with the vector of the lengths of the document collection in X
- document_frequency min_freq=2 (absolute value, would need to make PR for linfa) -- or maybe just construct the vocab list (only include duplicate words) and document fit separately
